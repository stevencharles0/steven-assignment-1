            <h3>Functional Music to Improve</h3>
            <h1 style="font-weight: bold;">Focus in 15 minutes</h1>
            <p>Our science-first approach creates music that sounds different-and affects your brain
                differently-than any other music.</p>

            <p style="font-weight: bold;">Patented Technology</p>
            <p>Brain.fm holds patents on key processes for creating functional music, including technology to elicit
                strong neural phase locking-allowing populations of neurons to engage in various kinds of coordinated
                activity-and technology to remove distraction in sounds.</p>
            <p>This makes our music unique, purpose-built to steer you into a desired mental state. In other words,
                we've found new ways to created music that helps you do what you need to do.</p>

            <p style="font-weight: bold;">Tested on brain and behavior</p>
            <p>Scientists at Brain.fm work with collaborators at academic institutions to run experiments.</p>
            <p>We look at the effects of our technology on the brain, using fMRI and EEG, and also run large-scale
                behavorial tests, measuring on surprise games.</p>
            <p>Our experiments always include a control condition (placebo) of the same underlying music without
                Brain.fm technology applied, so we can be sure our tech is what makes the differce.</p>
